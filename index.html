		<div>Fundamentals of LC/MS Workflow</div>
		<div>The Applied LCMS training course covers the major areas a Triple Quad / QTRAP customer will use. This will assist the engineer to better understand the many non-hardware related aspects of the covered systems. The course includes sample preparation, LC method modifications, compound optimization, quantitation including MultiQuant and IDA. Included in the training is extensive practice and advanced use of Analyst software. The course is taught from a Customer’ use perspective that highlights the potential areas of issues that may typically be encountered along the LC/MS workflow. This will allow the service engineer to gain experience on the workflow and to better diagnose potential application issues. The starting point of the course is a working system. Throughout the course, different scenarios will be covered that represent real-life examples seen in the field.

		<div>Competency</div>
		<div>This course will cover the operational theory and workflow of LC/MS. Topics that bring familiarization to the customer workflow (such as method development, source and compound optimization, method creation and data analysis) will be covered in detail. 
The learner will acquire the knowledge, tools and skills to successfully run through the LC/MS (customer) workflow. The FSEs will learn how to develop and optimize an LC/MS method. The learner will also acquire knowledge to quantitate data using both Analyst Quant and Multiquant.
